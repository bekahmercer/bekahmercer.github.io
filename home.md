# About Me

My name is Bekah. I work for a nonprofit in Oklahoma city serving victims of domestic violence, 
sexual assault, and human trafficking. I share my house with my two sons, 3 dogs, a cat, a bird, 
a fish and a tarantula (named Angela). I sometimes code.


# Goals

My goal for CTRL+SHIFT Code School is to have mostly happy students who learn a lot and all get
jobs they love in a few months. :)
